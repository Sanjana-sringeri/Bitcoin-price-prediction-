# Bitcoin-price-prediction-
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency which is found in 2008 
by Satoshi Nakamoto. The problem statement used in this task is 
to predict the bitcoin price prediction from the trained model. In 
this project I have used the dataset from Kaggle which contains 
the price values of the bitcoin from January 2012 to March 2021. 
I have implemented three algorithms to predict the price of the 
bitcoin which are namely Random forest, XGBoost, Recurrent 
Neural Network (RNN) and Long and Short term memory 
(LSTM) model to overcome the disadvantage of RNN. I 
compared the outcome of all three models which shows that the 
performance of LSTM is better compared to the remaining 
models. To compare the models I have used Root Mean Square 
values and mean absolute error values. The prediction of bitcoin 
price helps in the field of finance where one can decide about the 
future investments and the price variation in the bitcoin.
